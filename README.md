## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- At least 4GB RAM
- 20GB+ free disk space (more for video storage)

### Installation Method 1: Docker Hub (Recommended - 3 Minutes)

**Pull pre-built images and run immediately:**

1. **Download the configuration files**
```bash
# Create directory
mkdir vitransfer && cd vitransfer

# Download docker-compose.yml and .env.example
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer/main/.env.example
```

2. **Create and configure environment file**
```bash
# Copy and edit the file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Generate **5 unique** secure values:
```bash
# Generate these 5 values (each must be different):
openssl rand -hex 32      # 1. For POSTGRES_PASSWORD
openssl rand -hex 32      # 2. For REDIS_PASSWORD
openssl rand -base64 32   # 3. For ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -base64 64   # 4. For JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 64   # 5. For JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
```

Replace each placeholder in `.env`:
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<<REPLACE_WITH_openssl_rand_hex_32>>`
- `REDIS_PASSWORD=<<REPLACE_WITH_openssl_rand_hex_32>>`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY=<<REPLACE_WITH_openssl_rand_base64_32>>`
- `JWT_SECRET=<<REPLACE_WITH_openssl_rand_base64_64>>`
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<<REPLACE_WITH_openssl_rand_base64_64>>`

**Default admin credentials** (change in production):
- `ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin1234`

3. **Start the application**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. **Access ViTransfer**
- Open http://localhost:4321 (or your configured port)
- Login with your admin credentials
- Complete setup in admin settings

That's it! 🎉

---

### Installation Method 2: Build from Source (Advanced)

**For developers or contributors who want to build from source:**

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer.git
cd ViTransfer
```

2. **Follow steps 2-6 from Method 1 above**

3. **Build and start**
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The source code will be built into Docker images locally instead of pulling from Docker Hub.

---

## 🌐 Platform Support

ViTransfer uses standard Docker Compose and should work on most platforms.

**Planned Platform Guides:**
- Unraid (Docker Compose Manager)
- TrueNAS SCALE
- Synology NAS

**Community contributions welcome!** If you've successfully deployed on a specific platform, consider contributing installation guides.

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Access PostgreSQL
docker exec -it vitransfer-postgres psql -U vitransfer -d vitransfer

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs app

# Verify environment variables
docker-compose config

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart
```

```bash
# Check worker logs
docker-compose logs worker

# Verify FFmpeg is installed
docker exec vitransfer-worker ffmpeg -version

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### Can't login
- Verify `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- Check database connection: `docker-compose logs postgres`
- Reset password in database if needed

### Upload fails
- Check `client_max_body_size` in reverse proxy
- Verify disk space available
- Check upload permissions on volumes
