## What ViTransfer is
ViTransfer is a self-hosted video review and approval platform for filmmakers and video teams. It lets you upload originals, generate watermarked previews, share secure client links, collect timestamped feedback, and manage approval workflows.

## Core concepts
- Projects contain one or more videos, version history, and client recipients.
- Clients use share links to view, comment, and approve.
- Admins manage settings, security, analytics, and notifications.
- The worker handles background processing (transcoding + notifications).
